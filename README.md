## `string` Cleaning
### Where we got to

```python
ClnData['title'].str.replace(pat='[^a-z| ]', repl='', regex=True)
```
### Where Lynx had to save Max

```python
.str.replace()

# instead of using:
ClnData['title'].replace()

# and trying to figure this out:

# establish sad list
rem_chars = ["!",'\"',"#","%","&","'","(",")",
            "*","+",",","-",".","/",":",";","<",
            "=",">","?","@","[","\\","]","^","_",
            "`","{","}","~","â€“","|"]
rep_chars = ['' for i in range(len(rem_chars)-1)]
rep_chars.append(' ')
```
